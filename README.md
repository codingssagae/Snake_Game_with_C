# Snake Game

A simple yet engaging Snake Game developed using SDL and C++. This project demonstrates basic game development concepts such as rendering, input handling, collision detection, and game logic.

## Features

- **Classic Snake Gameplay**: Move the snake to eat food and grow longer while avoiding collisions with the walls and obstacles.
- **Obstacles**: Randomly generated obstacles that increase in number as you progress to higher levels.
- **Special Blue Food**: Eating blue food decreases your score and shortens the snake but increases the game speed.
- **Level Progression**: The game gets progressively harder with each level as more obstacles are added.
- **Blink Effect**: A visual blink effect when the player eats blue food.
- **Rotating Food Animation**: Blue food has a rotating animation for better visual appeal.
